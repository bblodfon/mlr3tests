# shiny-svms

Simple shiny app that demonstrates the effect of the cost parameter of an SVM 
binary classification model (margin, number of support vectors) and how it 
controls the variance-bias trade-off.

The [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org) framework is used to train the SVM model 
and [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) for the visualization.

Run app: `runApp()`.
