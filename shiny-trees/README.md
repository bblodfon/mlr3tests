# shiny-trees

Simple shiny app that demonstrates the effect of the complexity/regularization 
`cp` parameter of an `rpart` (classification tree) model on the model/tree size.

The [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org) framework is used to get the spam dataset, 
do the model training and visualize the trees.

Run app: `runApp()`.
